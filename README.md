# DM-Final-Project---Dugwell-Analysis


Motivation

Dugwells are still used as a major source of irrigation in India. The fifth Minor Irrigation (MI) Census has revealed considerable information about the status of dugwells in India, including the number of different types of dugwells in use, the social status of owners, the cost of maintenance, constraints in utilization, state wise and village wise distribution of dugwells, etc. The motive of our project is to use data mining techniques on the data provided by the Census to understand how various social and financial factors affect the distribution and status of dugwells in India.


Objective

The objective of project is twofold:


1.	Data pre-processing and visualization – To apply pre-processing techniques on the available crude data to make it easier and more efficient to use. Also, to visualize the data using various types of graphs and charts to visually understand the dynamics of the data.

2.	Data analysis – To apply the following data mining algorithms to the pre-processed data –

•	Clustering – To try various combinations of features such as the social status of the owner, energy source and financial source, depth of the dugwell, etc by feature selection techniques so that we can find clusters in our data which show similarity.

•	Classification - To classify the data based on the cost of maintenance of dugwells. The features such as hours of pumping water, government funding, depth of the dugwell, etc. will be used to classify the data into 2 classes: high or low cost of maintenance.
